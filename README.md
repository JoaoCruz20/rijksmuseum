This is was my thought process behind the development of the App

Pick of colors, theme, components, features ,setup. 
I first checked rijksmuseum website. How it was setup up visually. I loved the focus and use on images and the art it has.
I knew there that I wanted the something similar.
In my mind it would be the white background with the art. But art need to be framed, so all features would have a border. Has it was the framing.

With the background white picked the border has black, now  I need to pick a small color for buttons or other smaller components. Using the 60-20-10 rule . So I picked a small red.

Theme and colors were done. Now to features. I wanted art to visualized. So I went to research other museum websites and made a sketch with pieces from other places.

I wanted a intro feature, a navbar, the search bar and a carousel. Simple enough.

Navbar was two buttons between the logo and centered in center. Simplified and using the picked colors.
